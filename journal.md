## 12/4/2025 - Lets reverse engineer dji's Phanthom 4 design  

_Time spent: 6.5h_  

### For this phase of my project, I decided to closely study and reverse engineer the design of DJI’s Phantom 4. Instead of directly copying it, my goal was to understand why DJI made certain design choices and how those decisions affect flight stability, durability, and usability.

I started by analyzing the overall structure and layout of the Phantom 4. The most noticeable feature is its integrated monocoque-style body, where the arms and main shell feel like a single unified structure. This design helps distribute stress evenly across the frame and reduces weak points that are common in modular frames. The raised motor arms also improve propeller clearance and airflow, which likely contributes to smoother and more efficient flight.

Next, I looked at component placement. DJI places heavy components like the battery and main electronics near the center of gravity, which improves balance and makes the drone more stable during hover and sudden movements. The GPS module is positioned away from high-current components to reduce interference, while the camera and gimbal are isolated to minimize vibrations. These placements show how much importance DJI gives to clean sensor data and stable footage.

I also studied the material choices and thickness variations across the frame. The Phantom 4 shell is not uniformly thick—areas that experience higher stress, such as motor mounts and arm joints, are reinforced, while non-critical areas are kept thinner to save weight. This helped me understand that good drone design is not just about strong materials, but about using material efficiently.

Another important aspect I observed was aerodynamics and aesthetics working together. The smooth curves of the Phantom 4 are not just for looks; they reduce drag and protect internal components from dust and minor impacts. The integrated navigation lights and clean cable routing further show how DJI prioritizes both functionality and a professional finish.

Through this reverse engineering process, I gained a much deeper understanding of consumer drone design. This research will directly influence my own Phantom 4–inspired replica, especially in terms of frame geometry, component layout, and material selection. Overall, this step helped me move from simply building a drone to actually thinking like a drone designer and engineer.

## 12/26/2025 12 AM - I FORGOT TO TELL IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH A2212 BLDC MOTOR  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

### **I FORGOT TO TELL IT'S COMPATIBLE WITH A2212 BLDC MOTOR**
I ensured that the mounting holes match the standard A2212 bolt spacing and that there is enough clearance for motor rotation and wiring. This compatibility makes the design more versatile and reusable for different projects, especially in robotics and drone-related applications.

## 12/26/2025 12 PM - Final step: Let's Make Bill Of Material  

_Time spent: 3.5h_  

Today I completed the Bill of Materials (BOM) for my DJI Phantom 4–inspired drone frame. I carefully listed all the required components, including motors, ESCs, frame parts, fasteners, electronics, and the navigation LED setup. Making the BOM helped me clearly understand what parts are needed and how everything fits together in the overall design.

This step was important because it showed me the real cost, compatibility, and availability of components, especially for DIY and student builders. Now that the BOM is finalized, the project feels more structured and ready for the next phase. My next step will be to start ordering parts and preparing for assembly and testing.

## 12/26/2025 1:11 PM - cart screenshot and Project Submission  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Today I completed the Project and going to submit the project. I reviewed all the selected components one last time to make sure everything matched the BOM and project requirements. Taking the cart screenshots helped document the final parts list clearly and made the submission process smoother.

After uploading all the required details, I submitted the project with confidence. This step felt important because it marked the transition from planning to execution. With the submission done, the project is now ready to move forward into the next stage of building and testing.

## 12/26/2025 1:44 PM - made the led nav light board  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

completed the PCB design for the LED navigation lights of the drone. I converted the schematic into a proper PCB layout, carefully routing the traces and placing components to keep the board compact and easy to integrate into the frame. The design is optimized for clean wiring and reliable power distribution.

This PCB will make the navigation lights more durable and professional compared to loose wiring. With the LED navigation light PCB finished, the next step is to get it manufactured and test it with the flight controller once it arrives.![ANTI COLLISION LIGHT BOTTOM PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mjk4NjMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--221648094f3b7b5b34e61ef0ec6a5dd29357c720/ANTI%20COLLISION%20LIGHT%20BOTTOM%20PNG.PNG)

## 12/26/2025 1:46 PM - PDB Done  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

completed the PCB design for the Power Distribution Board (PDB). I designed the board to safely distribute power from the battery to the ESCs, flight controller, and other electronics. Special attention was given to trace width and layout to handle current properly and reduce voltage drop.

Designing the PDB made the electrical system more organized and reliable compared to direct wiring. With the PDB PCB finished, the project is now closer to final assembly, and the next step will be manufacturing and testing it along with the rest of the electronics.
